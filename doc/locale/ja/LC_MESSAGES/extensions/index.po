"Some **core extensions** come packaged with CKAN. Core extensions don't need"
" to be installed before you can use them as they're installed when you "
"install CKAN, they can simply be enabled by following the setup instructions"
" in each extension's documentation (some core extensions are already enabled"
" by default). For example, the :doc:`datastore extension "
"</maintaining/datastore>`, :doc:`multilingual extension "
"</maintaining/multilingual>`, and :doc:`stats extension "
"</maintaining/stats>` are all core extensions, and the :doc:`data viewer "
"</maintaining/data-viewer>` also uses core extensions to enable data "
"previews for different file formats."

"**External extensions** are CKAN extensions that don't come packaged with "
"CKAN, but must be downloaded and installed separately. A good place to find "
"external extensions is the `list of extensions on the CKAN wiki "
"<https://github.com/okfn/ckan/wiki/List-of-extensions>`_.  Again, follow "
"each extension's own documentation to install, setup and use the extension."
