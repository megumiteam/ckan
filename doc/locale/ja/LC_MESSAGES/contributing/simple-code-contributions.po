"The `'Good for Contribution' "
"<https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues?labels=Good+for+Contribution&state=open>`_"
" label on Github lists issues which are feasible for people who aren't "
"intimately familiar with CKAN's internals. Many of them are things which "
"would be extremely helpful if they got done, but the core team never seems "
"to get around to them. They're all busy wrestling with the problems that do "
"require familiarity with the internals. We hope this will make it easier for"
" more people to assist the CKAN project, by giving new developers places to "
"jump in."

"that require more knowledge of Python and CKAN. Do not despair if any "
"individual task seems daunting; there's probably an easier one. If you have "
"no programming skills, we can still use your help with documentation or "
"translation."
