"CKAN allows you to integrate its Edit Dataset and New Dataset forms forms "

"redirect these forms back to the external front-end upon submission."

"It is obviously simple enough for an external front-end to link to CKAN's "
"Edit Dataset and New Dataset forms, but once the forms are submitted, it "
"would be desirable to redirect the user back to the external front-end, "
"rather than CKAN's dataset read page."

"Since the 'return URL' may need to include the dataset name, which could be "
"changed by the user, CKAN replaces a known placeholder ``<NAME>`` with this "

"Note that the downside of specifying the 'return URL' in the CKAN config is "
"that the CKAN web interface becomes less usable on its own, since the user "
"is hampered by the redirects to the external interface."
