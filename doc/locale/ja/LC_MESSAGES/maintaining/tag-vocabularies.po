"Ofcourse, you could just add Avant-Garde, Beethoven, etc. to datasets as "
"normal CKAN tags, but using tag vocabularies lets you define Avant-Garde, "
"Country and Jazz as genres and Beethoven, Wagner and Tchaikovsky as "
"composers, and lets you enforce restrictions such as that each dataset must "
"have a genre and a composer, and that no dataset can have two genres or two "
"composers, etc."
