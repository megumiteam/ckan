"Solr can be set up to have multiple configurations and search indexes on the"
" same machine. Each configuration is called a Solr *core*. Having multiple "
"cores is useful when you want different applications or different versions "
"of CKAN to share the same Solr instance, each application can have its own "
"Solr core so each can use a different ``schema.xml`` file. This is "
"necessary, for example, if you want two CKAN instances to share the same "
"|solr| server and those two instances are running different versions of CKAN"
" that require differemt ``schema.xml`` files, or if the two instances have "
"different |solr| schema customizations."
