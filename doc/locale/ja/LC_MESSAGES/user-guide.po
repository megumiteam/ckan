"This user guide covers using CKAN's web interface to organize, publish and "

#: ../../user-guide.rst:17
msgid ""
"CKAN is a tool for making open data websites. (Think of a content management"
" system like WordPress - but for data, instead of pages and blog posts.) It "
"helps you manage and publish collections of data. It is used by national and"
" local governments, research institutions, and other organizations who "
"collect a lot of data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user-guide.rst:23
msgid ""
"Once your data is published, users can use its faceted search features to "
"browse and find the data they need, and preview it using maps, graphs and "
"tables - whether they are developers, journalists, researchers, NGOs, "
"citizens, or even your own staff."

"For CKAN purposes, data is published in units called \"datasets\". A dataset"
" is a parcel of data - for example, it could be the crime statistics for a "
"region, the spending figures for a government department, or temperature "
"readings from various weather stations. When users search for data, the "
"search results they see will be individual datasets."

"released under, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user-guide.rst:43
msgid ""
"A number of \"resources\", which hold the data itself. CKAN does not mind "
"what format the data is in. A resource can be a CSV or Excel spreadsheet, "
"XML file, PDF document, image file, linked data in RDF format, etc. CKAN can"
" store the resource internally, or store it simply as a link, the resource "
"itself being elsewhere on the web. A dataset can contain any number of "
"resources. For example, different resources might contain the data for "
"different years, or they might contain the same data in different formats."
